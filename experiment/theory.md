$$ Let\ A = Total\ area\ of\ surface. $$ 
$$ \overline{h} = Distance\ of\ C.G\ of\ the\ area\ from\ free\ surface\ $$

1. Consider a strip of thickness dh and width b at a depth of h from free surface of liquid as shown in figure 1.

    Pressure intensity on the strip 
    $$ p = \rho g h $$ 
    Area of the strip, 
    $$ dA = b \times dh $$ 
    Total pressure force on the strip,
    $$ dF = p \times Area = \rho g h \times b \times dh $$ 
    &therefore; Total pressure force on the whole surface 
    $$ F = \int dF = \int \rho g h \times b \times dh = \rho g \int b \times h \times dh  $$
    but
    $$ \int b \times h \times dh = \int h \times dA $$
    $$  = Moment\ of\ surface\ area\ about\ the\ free\ surface\ of\ liquid\ $$
    $$  = Area\ of\ surface \times Ditance\ of\ C.G\ from\ free\ surface $$
    $$ A \times \overline{h} $$
    $$ F = \rho g A \overline{h} \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ -> equation\ 1 $$
    &therefore; For water the value of &rho; = 100 kg/m<sup>3</sup> and g = 9.81 m/sec<sup>2</sup>. The force will be in Newtons.

2. The resultant force F is acting at P, at a distance h<sup>*</sup> from free surface of the liquid as shown in  figure 1. Hence moment of the force F about free surface of the liquid 

    $$ = dF \times h \ \ \ \ \ \ \ (because\ dF = \rho g h \times b \times dh) \ \ \ \ -> equation\ 2 $$ 
    $$ = \rho g h \times b \times dh \times h  $$ 
    Sum of moments of all such forces about free surface of liquid
    $$  = \int \rho g h \times b \times dh \times h = \rho g \int b \times h \times hdh  $$ 
    $$  = \rho g \int bh^2 dh = \rho g \int h^2dA \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ (because\ bdh = dA) $$ 
    but
    $$ \int h^2dA = \int bh^2 dh $$ 

    $$  = Moment\ of\ Intertia\ of\ the\ surface\ about\ free\ surface\ of\ liquid\ $$ 
    $$ = I_o $$

    &therefore; Sum of moments about free surface
      $$ = \rho g I_o \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ -> equation\ 3 $$

    equating equation 2 and 3, we get
    $$ F \times h^* = \rho g I_o $$ 
    but
    $$ F  = \rho g A \overline{h} $$ 
    therefore
    $$ \rho g h A \overline{h} \times h^* = \rho g I_o $$ 
    or
    $$ h^* = \frac{\rho g I_o}{\rho g A \overline{h}} = \frac{I_o}{A\overline{h}} \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ -> equation\ 4 $$
    by the theorem of prallel axis, we have
    $$ I_o = I_G + A \times \overline{h}^2 $$
    where I_G = Moment of Intertia of area about an axis passing through the C.G of the area and parallel to the free surface of the liquid

    Subtitution I<sub>o</sub> in equation 4, we get
    $$ h^* = \frac{I_G + A\overline{h}^2}{A\overline{h}} = \frac{I_G}{A\overline{h}} + \overline{h} \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ -> equation\ 5 $$


    1. Center of pressure (i.e h<sup>*</sup>) lies below the center of gravity of the vertical surface
    2. The distance of centre of pressure from free surface of liquid is independent of the density of the liquid.
